# Todo-Planner
A simple web-based to-do planner application that allows users to add tasks along with due dates. Tasks can be marked as completed, changing their appearance. The application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with jQuery for interactive functionality. Task data is stored in the browser's localStorage for persistence across sessions.

Feel free to adjust it as needed to best describe your project!
